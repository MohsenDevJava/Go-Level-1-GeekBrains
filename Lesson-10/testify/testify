
когда вы пишите тесты на чистом Go без testify. Какой подход вам нравится больше и почему?

Test method with testify is very convenient, less coding, strong documentation,
We can use Testify to create unit tests that assure it operates as intended.
When testing a component, we ideally want to isolate it completely to avoid having failures elsewhere to compromise our tests.
This is especially harder when the component we want to test has dependencies on other components from different layers in our software.
